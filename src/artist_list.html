                    <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0;">The Woodstock Music & Art Fair—informally, the Woodstock Festival or simply Woodstock—was a music festival
                        attracting an audience of 400,000 people, scheduled over three days on a dairy farm in New York state
                        from August 15 to 17, 1969 but which ran over four days to August 18, 1969.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0;">Billed as "An Aquarian Exposition: 3 Days of Peace & Music", it was held at Max Yasgur's 600-acre (240
                        ha; 0.94 sq mi) dairy farm in the Catskills near the hamlet of White Lake in the town of Bethel.[2]
                        Bethel, in Sullivan County, is 43 miles (69 km) southwest of the town of Woodstock, New York, in
                        adjoining Ulster County.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0;">During the sometimes rainy weekend, 32 acts performed outdoors before an audience of 400,000 people.[3]
                        It is widely regarded as a pivotal moment in popular music history, as well as the definitive nexus
                        for the larger counterculture generation.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0;">Rolling Stone listed it as one of the 50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0;">The event was captured in the Academy Award winning 1970 documentary movie Woodstock, an accompanying
                        soundtrack album, and Joni Mitchell's song "Woodstock", which commemorated the event and became a
                        major hit for both Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and Matthews Southern Comfort.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0;">Woodstock was initiated through the efforts of Michael Lang, John Roberts, Joel Rosenman, and Artie Kornfeld.
                        Roberts and Rosenman financed the project. Lang had some experience as a promoter, having co-organized
                        a small festival on the East Coast the prior year, the Miami Pop Festival, where an estimated 25,000
                        people attended the two-day event. Early in 1969, Roberts and Rosenman were New York City entrepreneurs,
                        in the process of building Media Sound, a large audio recording studio complex in Manhattan.</p>
